# Errors/warnings to ignore
# Put each error code on its own line if part of a list,
# or ensure comments are on separate lines.
# For extend-ignore, it's often a comma-separated list on one line,
# or if on multiple lines, each line should be just the code or part of the list.

# Option A: Comma-separated on one line, comment above
# Whitespace before ':' (E203 - often conflicts with Black)
# Line break before binary operator (W503 - PEP 8 changed, Black prefers after)
extend-ignore = E203, W503

# Option B: If your flake8 version/parser supports multi-line for extend-ignore clearly
# (This can be tricky, Option A is safer)
# extend-ignore =
#     E203  # Whitespace before ':' (often conflicts with Black)
#     W503  # Line break before binary operator (PEP 8 changed, Black prefers after)
# The issue here is that the comment might still be seen as part of the "value" of the last item.
